this homework was very hard for me. i received tutoring on what i found on the net... and i am not sure i would be able to do this solo just yet. 
i wish more time was spent on homework assignments to not feel like total failure with complicated javascript. maybe that is just me. 


// function Letter(let) {
//   this.charac = let;
//   this.appear = false;

//   this.letterRender = function() {
//     if (this.appear === false) {
//       return "__";
//     } else {
//       return this.charac;
//     }
//   }
// };

// module.exports = Letter;
